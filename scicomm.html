									<h4>ComSciCon-Virginia Tech</h4>
									<span class="image right"><img src="comscicon_logo.png" alt="ComSciCon logo showing an open book with a beaker and other scientific items coming out of it" /></span>
									<p>I spearheaded the efforts to organize Virginia Tech's first local <a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon</a>, a national franchise of a communicating science conference created by graduate students. The conference took place on March 7 and 8, 2019, in the Graduate Life Center. Co-sponsored by the Center for Communicating Science and the <a href="https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/">Global Change Center</a>, ComSciCon-Virginia Tech included workshops and panels from Virginia Tech professors, science journalists and editors, science authors, librarians, and former Nutshell Games winners. (See more about Nutshell Games below.)</p>
									<p>Information about the full workshop schedule and the application form are available on the <a href="https://communicatingscience.isce.vt.edu/Announcements.html">Center for Communicating Science website</a>. We accepted 60 applicants from graduate and advanced undergraduate students with an interest in science communication.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>Nutshell Games Talk</h4>
<p>In October 2018, I presented a talk about my dissertation research in under 90 seconds for the Nutshell Games, a speaking competition 
	hosted by the <a href="https://communicatingscience.isce.vt.edu/index.html">Center for Communicating Science</a> at Virginia Tech.</p>

									<hr />
									<h4>Preparing for the Nutshell Games</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="NutshellGamesworkshop.jpg" alt="Allison standing in a circle of other people playing a theatre game" /></span>About a week and a half before the competition, I attended a workshop designed to help participants prepare to condense their research into a 90-second snippet that public audiences could understand. <a href="https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2018/10/univrel-nutshellgamespreview.html">A story</a> featuring a picture of me and fellow participants was published in the VT News.</p>

									<h4>Science on Tap</h4>
									<p>Science on Tap is an awesome, ongoing series of events 
										in the Blacksburg, VA area where scientists 
										communicate their research to the public. 
										My husband, my dog, and I attended a presentation 
										on dog behavior in which Boris, our beagle-Australian 
										shepherd mix, got to participate! Here's an excerpt from 
									 <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/science-event-brings-the-laboratory-out-into-the-public/article_5cea5017-9ad6-543d-aa99-25fae241ea78.html">
										a Roanoke Times article</a> by Robby Korth, who interviewed me about the event:</p>
									<p><blockquote>For those in attendance, the event delivers important exposure to scientific research. Allison Hutchison, a graduate student in Tech’s English department, attended the event with her husband and dog Boris, who was given some lessons on canine behavior.</p>

<p>She brought students from a science writing course she taught last semester to a Science on Tap event. For the general public, combining beer with learning will lead to good times, she said.</p>

<p>“This is an event people need to open their Thursdays up to,” Hutchison said. “Science can be fun.”</p></blockquote>
