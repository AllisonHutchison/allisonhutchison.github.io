							</h2>
                        <p>I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Rhetoric & Writing program at Virginia Tech, a writing center ninja, and a music aficionada. I am an experienced educator in both online and face-to-face settings with a strong passion for
                            student engagement and success.
                            <br />

                            <p>I love learning, teaching, and tutoring. My goals are to teach writing, direct a multiliteracy center, and improve my ninja skills. My axiom in all of the above situations is, "If we're not having fun, we're not doing it right."</p>

								"Assessing the Feasibility of Online Writing Support for Technical Writing Students"</h2>
                            <p>In this project, I study the feasibility of creating online tutoring services for students enrolled in the technical writing service course. Blending user experience and service design methodologies, I surveyed and interviewed
                                key stakeholders in order to design a digital studio that offers resources and services that best meet their needs. The 360 Digital Studio opened as a pilot study in Fall 2018 with myself as coordinator, another graduate
                                student as assistant coordinator, and three undergraduate Professional & Technical Writing majors as interns.</p>

								Mission Statement Analysis</h2>
                            <p>Using Cheryl Geisler's (2004) systematic coding approach to verbal data, I coded and analyzed 100 mission statements from writing centers in the United States. After an initial round of analysis focusing on the representation
                                of writing center work on websites, I developed this research question: <i>What kinds of claims do writing centers in the United States make about the benefits of their work through mission statements posted on their websites?</i>
                                <br />
                                <p>I used a criterion method to extract sections of mission statements into a spreadsheet that were then segmented for coding. Seven benefits of writing centers emerged from the data: epistemological, critical thinking, independence,
                                    success, research, writers, and supporting the institution. The inter-rater reliability is 90%, and the Cohen's Kappa calculation is considered good at 0.722.</p>

                            <p>Teaching this course online in 3 abbreviated semesters, I exposed students to technical genres such as research and goods and services proposals, progress reports, infographics, and instructions. I held online office hours
                                and provided video feedback to students in an effort to create immediacy between them, the course content, and myself. Students could also contact me via Google chat with more urgent questions. Finally, I employed a user-centered
                                approach by surveying and gathering feedback from students to ensure the online course used principles of visual and information design to make course content easily accessible and navigable.

                            <p>Students closely analyzed the structure and content of scientific journal articles in IMRAD format and traced connections between scientific writing and classical and current rhetoric. After exploring writing about primary
                                scientific research, students interviewed VT science students and wrote spotlight stories about their research. The interviews highlighted the research of women and people of color in the sciences. The course culminated
                                in a collaborative project focused on science writing. Students were responsible for developing the content and format of this project in partnership with the Center for Communicating Science and under my advisement and

                                reports, user documents, recommendation reports, and job application packages. Not only did they learn about writing for workplace settings from readings, but they also interviewed professionals who write as either a main
                                or or secondary component of their jobs. I emphasized that they compose documents intended to solve problems or help readers make decisions.</p>
