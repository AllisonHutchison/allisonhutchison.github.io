            <h2>What kind of ninja?</h2>
            <p>I'm a first-year PhD student in the Rhetoric & Writing program at Virginia Tech, a writing center ninja, and a music aficionada. I love learning, teaching, and tutoring. My goals are to teach writing, direct a writing center, and improve my ninja skills. My mantra in all of the above situations is, "If we're not having fun, we're not doing it right."</p>

		Here we are. What happens next? You insert your content.
		But first you need your grid.
		See line 26 above? That opens your container (also known as your wrapper... not rapper).
		And then at the bottom we have the </div> that closes your container. Below that, we have the scripts that Bootstrap needs in order to do some fancy transitions and stuff. We shouldn't touch them. Don't delete them.
		Your grid structure neeeds rows and colums, so go ahead and add as many rows as your mockup needs. They all should look like this:

		<div class="row">

		</div>

		Super simple!! Give a unique id to each row if you want/need to for formatting and semantic purposes. Like this:

		<div class="row" id="pictures">

		</div>

		And then in your custom.css file you can make unique rules for #pictures. Awesome.

		Now, add columns to each row. Bootstrap, if you read its docs, has several sizes for columns based on screen and device sizes. If you want to avoid drama, I say you stick with making all columns medium. Remember, your total of columns per row should be 12. Example:

		<div class="row" id="picures">
		  <div class="col-md-12">
		  <p>This is one single column taking all 12 columns inside my #pictures row</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		Make combinations of 12 as needed, and you can also offset columns to skip some and position content beyond column one. Example:

		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-7">
		      <p>I skip seven columns! I won't start on column 1!</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		</div>

		And then go to your custom.css file and make rules for your ids and classes. Do not worry about the bootstrap css file(s).
