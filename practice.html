								<h2>About Me<br />
							</h2>
								<p>I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Rhetoric & Writing program at Virginia Tech, a writing center ninja, and a music aficionada. I am an experienced educator in both online and face-to-face settings with a strong passion for student engagement and success.<br />

<p>I love learning, teaching, and tutoring. My goals are to teach writing, direct a writing center, and improve my ninja skills. My mantra in all of the above situations is, "If we're not having fun, we're not doing it right."</p>

								<h2>Dissertation Abstract<br />
								"Writing Support for the Online Technical Writing Course: A Feasibility Study"</h2>
								<p>In this project, I study the feasibility of creating online tutoring services for students enrolled in the technical writing service course. Blending user experience and service design methodologies, I surveyed and interviewed key stakeholders in order to design a digital studio that offers resources and services that best meet their needs. The 360 Digital Studio is opening as a pilot study in Fall 2018 with myself as coordinator, another graduate student as assistant coordinator, and three undergraduate Professional & Technical Writing majors as interns.</p>

								<h2>Writing Center<br />
								Mission Statement Analysis</h2>
								<p>Using Cheryl Geisler's (2004) systematic coding approach to verbal data, I coded and analyzed 100 mission statements from writing centers in the United States. After an initial round of analysis focusing on the representation of writing center work on websites, I developed this research question: <i>What kinds of claims do writing centers in the United States make about the benefits of their work through mission statements posted on their websites?</i><br />
								<p>
I used a criterion method to extract sections of mission statements into a spreadsheet that were then segmented for coding. Seven benefits of writing centers emerged from the data: epistemological, critical thinking, independence, success, research, writers, and supporting the institution. The inter-rater reliability is 90%, and the Cohen's Kappa calculation is considered good at 0.722.</p>

								<h2>Writing Program Administrators Graduate Organization<br />
								Labor Census Task Force</h2>
								<p>As co-chair of this task force, I helped collect data about the labor conditions of Graduate Student
Instructors (GSIs) in university writing programs in the United States. Our goal is to
make this information public and available so that WPAs, prospective GSIs/TAs, and
current GSIs/TAs can have a better understanding of the labor conditions at specific
universities and larger trends across the country. We are currently compiling results and a report to share with WPA-GO and any other interested parties soon.</p>

									<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vcD-cndI8vgzhSeXq47vnGVuyesADVTf/view">Technical Writing</a></h3>
									<p>Number of Sections: 3</p>
									<p>Students gain an understanding of the theories, issues, and practices of technical communicationsthey might encounter in the workplace, such as general correspondence, proposals, reports, and presentations. From a foundation based on the principles of rhetoric, students learn to analyze writing situations, consider audience needs, assemble researched and original evidence, and design final documents that are user friendly and visually persuasive. Finally, students not only to understand these documents, but also to produce them with ease and confidence.
</p>

									<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15DHd7hYFzihLv8Mr4jWYBeWiJQ_Y-Ri9/view">Science Writing</a></h3>
									<p>Students closely analyzed the structure and content of scientific journal articles in IMRAD format andtraced the origins of writing about scientific research and its connection to classical and current rhetoric. After exploring writing about primary scientific research, students interviewed VT science students and wrote spotlight stories about their research. The interviews highlighted the research of women and people of color in the sciences. The course culminated in a collaborative project focused on science writing. Students were responsible for developing the content and format of this project in partnership with the Center for Communicating Science and under my advisement and direction.</p>

									<h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GeI-1YBKdIG6B0-O3wS9gveJxjYxb7xrMc9EP41fJU/edit?usp=sharing">Professional Writing</a></h3>
									<p>This course introduces students to the theory and practice of professional writing and its functions inworkplace settings. In this rhetorically-based course, students gain experience with a variety of writing situations, composing documents that solve problems or help readers make decisions. Students learn current conventions and broadly applicable procedures for analyzing the audiences, purposes, and situations of professional writing, and learn strategies for adapting these conventions and procedures to meet the unique demands of each new situation and task.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>MSE Professional Development I</h3>
									<p>Materials Science and Engineering 2884 is designed to prepare students to describe : non-technicalprofessional skills needed for career success; the roles communication and related professional skillsplay in engineering practice; characteristics of effective workplace communication; and issues associated with collaborating in the global, multidisciplinary workplace. Students also describe and enact the process of effective communication (including written, oral, and visual). Lastly, students reflectively assess their abilities with respect to one or more professional skills, including strengths, weaknesses, and plans for professional development.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Introduction to Materials Science & Engineering</h3>
									<p>Number of sections: 3 as GTA</p>
									<p>As the course title suggests, students learn the introductory principles of materials science and engineering, including the structure, properties, processings, and performance of basic material groups such as polymers, ceramics, and metals. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>First-Year Writing</h3>
									<p>Number of sections: 9 online, 4 face-to-face</p>
									<p>I taught various iterations of this course at an online university and two community colleges. Each version emphasized gathering, synthesizing, and citing secondary research; writing in informational, persuasive, and reflective modes; and learning aspects of academic writing meant to prepare students for additional courses requiring researched essay writing.</p>

    <p><b>Professional Writing Student,</b> <i>Virginia Tech</i></p>
    <p>"Professor Hutchison was by far one of the most inspiring instructors I've had in my experience here at Virginia Tech. 
        Her engagement and belief in all of her students combined with her honesty and humor made me as a student excited about my 
        life and invested in the course material. Her enthusiasm for our work and course concepts meant something different to all 
        of us, and there was much meaning from this course to be felt, taken, and interpreted."</p>
    <p><b>Science Writing Student,</b><i> Virginia Tech</i> </p>"Mrs. Hutchison was an 
      incredible teacher. Many instructors try, but fail, to incorporate class discussions, projects, and other non-traditional 
      teaching methods in place of
simple lectures. Mrs. H was able to make all of those methods work because she designed the course conscientiously and encouraged 
      each student to think and
contribute. Throughout the class, she incorporated reflection on how our discussions connected to bigger principles in science 
      writing. Group projects, which can be a drag
in other courses, were lively and produced excellent deliverables. This course went beyond how to be a science writer; it asked 
      important questions about science,
rhetoric, and communication."
    <p><b>Materials Science & Engineering Professional Development Student,</b> 
        <i>Virginia Tech</i></p>
    <p>“She really made the class feel less like a class by encouraging us to always share our thoughts and ask questions. In addition 
        the feedback she gives on class projects is very thourough and helps me improve as a student."</p><br>
