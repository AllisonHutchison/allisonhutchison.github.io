# ENGRC 3340: Independent Study in Engineering Communications, Spring 2021
Dr. Allison Hutchison, Senior Lecturer in the Engineering Communications Program, organized this research team along with two assistant professors after doing a project for several semesters where engineering students analyzed job ads they were interested in applying to. In the short reports that students wrote, Hutchison found initial evidence that communication and collaboration skills were almost always included in engineering job ads, but students often overlooked including these skills in their resumes.

8 Undergraduate CoE researchers sought to understand engineering, risk communication, and UX job ads better by scraping data from Indeed and Glassdoor. The team wanted to know:
- **Research Question 1:** What are the desired communication and collaboration skills mentioned in full-time entry-level jobs and internship advertisements in engineering fields?
- **Research Question 2:** Do trends in communication and/or collaboration skills appear in various job titles?
- **Research Question 3:** How frequently do specific communication and collaboration keywords appear in job advertisements? What does that tell engineering students about the kind of candidates employers are looking for?
